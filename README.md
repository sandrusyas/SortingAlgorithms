# Sorting Algorithms :one: :two: :three:
The program for demonstrating sorting algorithms.

The program implements three sorting algorithms — *Bubble Sort, Selection Sort,* and *Shuttle Sort*. Each algorithm demonstrates a different principle of data ordering and can be visually compared in terms of efficiency and behavior. A detailed description of their working principles can be found at the provided reference link.

[Details about sorting algorithms](https://dev.to/m__mdy__m/basic-sorting-5h20)

The program interface consists of control elements that allow the user to set sorting parameters and observe the process. The user selects the number of elements, enters numbers into a text box separated by spaces, and chooses a sorting algorithm from the list. 
+ After pressing the **“Create Array”** button, a graphical visualization of the entered numbers appears on the panel — displayed as circles or bars depending on the selected algorithm.
+ Pressing the **“Sort”** button starts the sorting process, which is shown step by step with animation.
+ After completion, the sorted array is displayed in the “After Sorting” field, and the **“Clear”** button prepares the program for a new demonstration.
